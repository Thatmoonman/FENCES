      <hr class="solid">
      <p>In FENCES, you are tasked with getting your piece (BLUE) from one end of the board to the other.</p>
      <p>Simple, right? Well your opponent (RED) is trying to do the same!</p>
      <p>So how do you stop them?</p>
      <p>WITH FENCES OF COURSE!</p>
      <p>You can place a fence to block their movement, but beware!</p>
      <p>Where you block them, you also block yourself,</p>
      <p>so don't FENCE yourself in!</p>
      <hr class="solid">
      <ul>How To Play:
        <li>Click your piece to select it, you can move to any adjacent square or "jump" your opponent.</li>
        <li>Fences cannot be crossed, so place them wisely!</li>
        <li>Valid moves will be highlighted in green, click a highlighted square to move there.</li>
        <li>To Place a fence: simply select the BLUE block off screen.</li>
        <li>Select a fence posts where you would like the fence to start, and then a post next to it.</li>
        <li>Click & Drag or swipe to move the camera around and zoom and out.</li>
        <li>Spacebar returns the camera to it's starting position.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>About the Developer:</h1>
      <hr class="solid">
      <p>My name is Justin Kilburn.</p>
      <p>I am a fullstack software engineer currently living in Brooklyn, NY with my girlfriend and two cats.</p>
      <p>While working as a barista, I started learning to code in 2022.</p> 
      <p>I promptly fell in love with the challenge of it.</p>
      <p>This project was a testament to that love of a challenge.</p>
      <hr class="solid">
      <p>FENCES is based on the minimalism board game Quoridors™️.</p>
      <p>It utilizes the Three.js library to render Javascript and HTML/CSS in 3D.</p>
      <p>I love the idea of simple rules and complex strategy.</p>
      <p>I made FENCES as a simple representation of complex ideas.</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it!</p>
