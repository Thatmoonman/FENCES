      <h1>WELCOME TO FENCES</h1>
      <p>In FENCES, you are tasked with getting your piece (BLUE) from one end of the board to the other.</p>
      <p>Simple, right? Well your opponent (RED) is trying to do the same!</p>
      <p>So how do you stop them?</p>
      <p>WITH FENCES OF COURSE!</p>
      <p>You can place a fence to block their movement, but beware!</p>
      <p>Where you block them, you also block yourself,</p>
      <p>so don't FENCE yourself in!</p>

      <ul>How To Play:
        <li>Click your piece to select it, you can move to any adjacent square or "jump" your opponent.</li>
        <li>Fences cannot be crossed, so place them wisely!</li>
        <li>Valid moves will be highlighted in green, click a highlighted square to move there.</li>
        <li>To Place a fence: simply select the BLUE block off screen.</li>
        <li>Select a fence posts where you would like the fence to start, and then a fence post next to it.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>GOOD LUCK!</h2>

      <h1>About the Developer:</h1>
      <p> My name is Justin Kilburn. I have lived in New York City for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Most of that time I worked in hospitality, but decided to learn to code in 2022</p> 
      <p>I promptly fell in love with the challenge of it.</p>
      <p>This project was a testament to that love of a challenge.</p>
      <p>FENCES is based on the minimalist-style boardgame Quoridors™️.</p>
      <p>I love the idea of simple rules and complex strategy. </p>
      <p>I chose to make FENCES as a simple representation of complex ideas.</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it!</p>
